* Notes
** IRN
We are using Inception Residual Blocks as mentioned in https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.03799.pdf for efficient feature aggregation 
(less computation and training time as mentioned in: https://openreview.net/pdf?id=q7kqBkL33f8LEkD3t7X9)
** Entropy bottleneck
We learn the distribution of the output tensor using the Entropy bottleneck layer and we use it to perform arithmetic
encoding and decoding of the output tensor. (https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.01436.)
